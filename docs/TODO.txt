TODO
  * bundle the html/js stuff
  * maybe even if server is very fast, don't try to rerender the page as fast as possible
  * add requester-id to each search result so we can track which div to update
  * use async await so that the results of the search are published BEFORE the search suggestions
  * make a test version of the database for the server to use for integration testing
  * handle capitalization of search terms; be acronym aware
  * how to set up for pip install? (maybe just a setup.py file)
  * how should python files be organized? Want to move business logic out of the web server
  * better regex to clean text in items
