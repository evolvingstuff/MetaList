TODO
  * a BUNCH of unit tests for decorate_item()
  * allow for ctrl-<arrow> to move stuff as well
  * unify vocab:
    * prev/next vs above/below
  * consider multi-select for indent/outdent operations again
  * consistent naming conventions
    * e vs evt
  * drag/resize editing bar
  * maybe have editing bar move to side if there is enough screen space
  * show current tags in editing bar
    * main / parent / child
  * -@done doesn't work in an intuitive way
  * do proper modern js imports
  * auto-select child nodes?
  * bundle the html/js stuff
  * maybe even if server is very fast, don't try to rerender the page as fast as possible
  * add requester-id to each search result so we can track which div to update
  * use async await so that the results of the search are published BEFORE the search suggestions
  * make a test version of the database for the server to use for integration testing
  * handle capitalization of search terms; be acronym aware
  * how to set up for pip install? (maybe just a setup.py file)
  * how should python files be organized? Want to move business logic out of the web server
  * better regex to clean text in items
