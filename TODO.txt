TODO
  * the search box should be a component that can be reused on other pages
  * how to set up for pip install?
  * prefer not to rely on bottle for templating
  * I need a component framework for the UI
  * I need a pub/sub framework for the UI
  * need parsing of the search query both on the client and the server
    * client side parsing is for the search box, illegal characters should be removed, or the search should be disabled
    * server side parsing is for the search results
  * add unit tests, and a test runner, and a test coverage tool
